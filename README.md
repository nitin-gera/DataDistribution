# DataDistribution

This application acts as a data distribution system which receives both unicast and multicast data on UDP socket and then relays it to one or multiple UDP sockets in unicast or multicast mode.

The configuration for reading and writing data is provided through a XML file placed in the project directory. Thus, it also demonstrates reading of XML file using Qt Dom Document.
